## Fucked-up tomato

Fucked-up tomato  
Fucked-up tomato  

Your flaws are mine  
You grew in my apartment  
I hope that I helped  
I used the soil  
From a fern I over-  
-loved and watered  

Can you tell?  
Do the ghosts of other plants  
Still linger  
In the mulch you sit in?  
Are you ever alone?  

Fucked-up tomato  
Fucked-up tomato  

Your sins are mine  
Inherited from the day  
I left the ground  
Three floors below  
To live in a box  

That's stacked  
Above and below  
With abstract neighbours  
How can this be right?  

Fucked-up tomato  
Dearest tomato  

Your strength is mine  
Your fragile sweetness  
Is mine to consume  
In the world's worst salad  
With mozzerella  

From the supermarket  
50 yards away  
That I went to  
All through Covid.  
How can this be right?
