## Like Ed Sheeran

I wish I could write  
Like Ed Sheeran  
Like Ed Sheeran  
Funky beats  
\+ harmonies  
Hooks that gleam  
Sales and streams  
That ×  

Ernest Hemingway once said  
"Writing is easy — just sit down and bleed"  
But honestly I'd rather lay down a lick  
Then head into town to watch Ipswich FC  

I wish I could write  
Like Ed Sheeran  
Like Ed Sheeran  
Workmanlike  
Can't help but ÷  
The likes of people  
Who'll never =  
His records  

Thinking out loud here let's get it on tape  
You don't get no love from scrubs but the shape  
Of your melodies fits into every room  
There's only so many ways to deliver a tune  

I wish I could write  
Like Ed Sheeran  
Like Ed Sheeran  
Suffolk them all  
Suffolk my life  
Would anyone pay  
For a table made  
With more than four legs?
