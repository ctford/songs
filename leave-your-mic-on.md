## Leave your mic on

I sensed you were frustrated  
After that last interview  
So much time was spent on gotchas  
So little time on getting you  

You slumped and shook your head  
Opened your mouth but then right on cue  
They cut your mic  
So what your real take was I never knew  

Please leave your mic on  
Leave your mic on, honey  
I want to hear from you  
I believe some stupid shit  
For stupid reasons too  
I want to hear from you  

I know the latest focus group  
Has raised a flag (or maybe two)  
But do people really want politicians  
That PR firms tell what to do?  

You're a leader, lead me  
To ideas so far out I never knew  
Open up my Overton window  
And let daylight come streaming through  

So leave your mic on  
Leave your mic on, honey  
I want to hear from you  
I believe some stupid shit  
For stupid reasons too  
I want to hear from you  

"On all these issues  
But particularly missile defense  
This can be solved  
But it's important for him  
To give me space"  

"Does anyone ever say  
You've done a fucking good job  
Because everyone else  
Has sat on their fucking arse  
And done nothing?"  

"That was a disaster  
Should never have put me with that woman  
Whose idea was that?  
She was just a sort of bigoted woman  
Who said she used to be Labour"  

Oh leave your mic on  
Leave your mic on, honey  
I want to hear from you  
I believe some stupid shit  
For stupid reasons too  
I want to hear from you
