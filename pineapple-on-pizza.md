## Pineapple on pizza

Why do I mind it  
When other people love  
Things I don't personally approve of?  
Pineapple on pizza  
Or sugar in coffee  
What harm to me?  

My friend Ren√©e  
Did important things first  
She began with dessert  
And worked back to mains  

Why do I mind it  
When other people love  
Things I don't personally approve of?  
Pineapple on pizza  
Or sugar in coffee  
What harm to me?  

My friend Dave  
Had sensitive tastes  
So all that he ate  
Was a shade of beige  

What time is it?  
It's half-past three  
Too late for lunch  
Too early for tea  
So I'll sit here    
And suck my teeth  
'Till society says  
It's time to eat  

Why do I mind it  
When other people love  
Things I don't personally approve of?  
Sugar on pizza  
Pineapple in coffee  
What harm to me?  

My friend Neil  
Like some, liked it hot
Used tabasco (why not?)  
On every meal  

Peeping through windows  
Peering through doors  
If I spoil my dinner  
It shouldn't spoil yours  
Climbing through windows  
Sidling through doorways  
No one needs food police  
Defending culinary mores
