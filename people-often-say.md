## People often say

People often say that I  
Remind them of themselves  
I can't help but think that that's  
Bad for my mental health  

I don't respect my boundaries  
So why should anyone else?  
If I'm in thrall to others needs  
How can I love myself?  

Oh, things look bad  
But they've looked this bad before  
Oh, park your bags  
And we'll talk it out some more
