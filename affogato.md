## Affogato

Held back by homework  
And held in by heat  
Coffee is bitter  
But ice cream is sweet  

Affogato  
On a summer afternoon  
Affogato  
Measure my life in ice cream spoons  

No driver's licence  
And nowhere to go  
I give you a call  
And of course you're at home  

Affogato  
On a summer afternoon  
Affogato  
Measure my life in ice cream spoons  

My tastes have evolved  
But I'll always miss  
That caffeine surprise  
That vanilla kiss  
I wonder if you  
Would still like them too  
If only  
You had made it  

Oh I've been to cities  
I've had microfoam  
But sometimes I just want  
What I make at home  

Affogato  
On a summer afternoon  
Affogato  
Measure my life in ice cream spoons  

I s'pose I've moved on  
No longer fifteen  
No longer a child  
As you'll always be  
I wonder what you'd  
Have chosen to do  
If only  
You had made it  

I know there are fashions  
On how to serve your addictions  
But nothing's cool as ice  
On the roof of my mouth  
I hold it as long as I can  

It's far too hot now  
To head into town  
So I'll read my future  
In white swirls and brown  

Affogato  
On a summer afternoon  
Affogato  
Measure my life in ice cream spoons
