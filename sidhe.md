## Sidhe

A young man once a wand'ring went  
He deemed he'd come of age  
He severed every earthly tie  
And cursed his home a cage  

His tracks, which trailed the setting sun  
A thousand furlongs spanned  
Pressed in clay and marked in mud  
And printed on the sand  

At last he reached the border peaks  
With which the world is crowned  
He sought a tarn to bathe his feet  
And such a tarn he found  


"A giant cupped his gnarl√©d hand  
To pool the liquid sky"  
"Some vain goddess's looking glass  
Let fall and then let lie"  

So read his later vain attempts  
To capture with his pen  
A crystal well of wilderness  
Transcending mortal ken  

Yet as he stood in reverie  
The nightfall stole around  
Starlight glittered high above  
And mist rose from the ground  


And then, reflected in the tarn  
The starlight coalesced  
Our hero's inner fantasy  
Of loveliness, expressed!  

Her skin was white as angels' robes  
Her hair swirled black as pitch  
Two shards of ice comprised her eyes  
Two drops of blood her lips  

But as he bent to better see  
His touch disturbed the water  
Her face dissolved and left him only  
Faint and distant laughter  


Now memory fades, unwanted thoughts  
Disturb him in the dark  
Was she merely fancy spun  
To sooth a lonely heart?
