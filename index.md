## Songs

Lyrics to my songs.


### Dolorem ipsum

"Neque porro quisquam est  
Qui dolorem ipsum
Quia dolor sit amet  
Consectetur  
Adipisci velit"  
Cicero sighed  
And laid down his quill  


### Fuck you McKenzie

Fuck you McKenzie  

Fuck  
You  
McKenzie  

Fuck you McKenzie  
You have fucked me over again  

I'd balanced the till  
I'd stocked the shelves  
I'd mopped the fucking floor  
And then you waltzed in here McKenzie  
With your shitty fucking paws  


### West with the sun

I'll run away  
I'll get away  
But my heart will go west  
With the sun  

A parting kiss  
Like fairy floss  
Dissolves on the tip  
Of my tongue
