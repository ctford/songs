Cicero opined  
And laid down his quill  

I don't love pain  
For its own sake  
It's just a mark  
To hold my place  
A starting point  
A piece of space  
Where good and evil  
Can take place

Cicero sighed  
And took up his quill  


## Fuck you McKenzie

Fuck you McKenzie  

Fuck  
You  
McKenzie  

Fuck you McKenzie  
You have fucked me over again  

I closed the till  
I stacked the shelves  
I mopped the fucking floor  
And then you waltzed in here McKenzie  
With your shitty fucking paws  

I live in a town just a pub and a shop  
A Rockatansky place  
There's precious little going on  
Occupying a fuckload of space  

I have to eat and I want to drink  
And for that I need some money  
So I do my hours at the local shop  
It's double time on Sunday  

Fuck you McKenzie  

Fuck  
You  
McKenzie  

Fuck you McKenzie  
You have fucked me over again  

I made my peace  
Through gritted teeth  
I shut and locked the gate  
And then you sauntered past McKenzie  
Like you thought that we were mates  

Fuck you  
Fuck me  
Fuck this sunburnt fucking country  
Get fucked if you tell me  
That I shouldn't mind  

Fuck the roos  
Fuck the rabbits  
Fuck the sheep in the paddocks  
And unfuck my life  
If you would be so kind  

It's in-fucking-credible  
How in-fucking-edible  
A meat pie becomes  
In the oven all day  

You flaming galah  
(just joking, yeah nah  
That isn't something that I really say)  

Fuck you McKenzie  

Fuck  
You  
McKenzie  

Fuck you McKenzie  
You have fucked me over again  

Okay, alright  
Here's your fucking feed  
No need to piss and moan  
And don't thank me McKenzie  
Right, well I'm off home  

You're the cat with the cream  
Yet you piss on my sorrow  
Fuck you McKenzie  
And see you tomorrow  


## Moments of glass

I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
They're harder and harder to find  

It's not that the light is getting dim  
There's just a spiderweb of fissures in  
The medium that sits 'tween you and me  

I try to look at you  
I think you try and see me too  
But light and life and love  
Refract away  

I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
It seems they're in short supply  

Your eyes are bright your face is warn  
Your accent floating somewhere on  
The boat you slipped aboard  
For just ten pounds  

When you disembarked mother enquired  
About a maid to "do for her"  
A laugh, "Best get used to  
Doing for yourself"  

I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
You don't know who I am  
But you're kind  


## People often say

People often say that I  
Remind them of themselves  
I can't help but think that that's
Bad for my mental health  

I don't respect my boundaries  
So why should anyone else?  
If I'm in thrall to others needs  
How can I love myself?  

Oh, things look bad  
But they've looked this bad before  
Oh, park your bags  
And we'll talk it out some more  


## West with the sun

I'll run away  
I'll get away  
But my heart will go west  
With the sun  

A parting kiss  
Like fairy floss  
Dissolves on the tip  
Of my tongue  

I stumble past  
The watershed  
And I like a river  
Will run  

Into a sea  
Of salt and scree  
My shadow stretching  
Out in front
