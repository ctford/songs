Lyrics to my songs.


### Dolorem ipsum

"Neque porro quisquam est  
Qui dolorem ipsum  
Quia dolor sit amet  
Consectetur  
Adipisci velit"  
Cicero sighed  
And laid down his quill  


### Fuck you McKenzie

Fuck you McKenzie  

Fuck  
You  
McKenzie  

Fuck you McKenzie  
You have fucked me over again  

I'd balanced the till  
I'd stocked the shelves  
I'd mopped the fucking floor  
And then you waltzed in here McKenzie  
With your shitty fucking paws  


### Moments of glass

I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
They're harder and harder to find  

It's not that the light is getting dim  
There's just a spiderweb of fissures in  
The medium that sits 'tween you and me  

I try to look at you  
I think you try and see me too  
But light and life and love  
Refract away  

I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
It seems they're in short supply  

Your eyes are bright your face is warn  
Your accent floating somewhere on  
The boat you slipped aboard  
For just ten pounds  

When you disembarked mother enquired  
About a maid to "do for her"  
A laugh, "Best get used to  
Doing for yourself"  

I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
You don't know who I am  
But you're kind  


### People often say

People often say that I  
Remind them of themselves  
I can't help but think that that's
Bad for my mental health  

I don't respect my boundaries  
So why should anyone else?  
If I'm in thrall to others needs  
How can I love myself?  

Oh, things look bad  
But they've looked this bad before  
Oh, park your bags  
And we'll talk it out some more  


### West with the sun

I'll run away  
I'll get away  
But my heart will go west  
With the sun  

A parting kiss  
Like fairy floss  
Dissolves on the tip  
Of my tongue  

I stumble past  
The watershed  
And I like a river  
Will run  

Into a sea  
Of salt and scree  
My shadow stretching  
Out in front
