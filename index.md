## Songs

Lyrics to my songs.


### Dolorem ipsum

"Neque porro quisquam est  
Qui dolorem ipsum
Quia dolor sit amet  
Consectetur  
Adipisci velit"  
Cicero sighed  
And laid down his quill  


### West with the sun

I'll run away  
I'll get away  
But my heart will go west  
With the sun  

A parting kiss  
Like fairy floss  
Dissolves on the tip  
Of my tongue
