## Fuck you McKenzie

Fuck you McKenzie  

Fuck  
You  
McKenzie  

Fuck you McKenzie  
You have fucked me over again  

I closed the till  
I stacked the shelves  
I mopped the fucking floor  
And then you waltzed in here McKenzie  
With your shitty fucking paws  

I live in a town just a servo and a pub  
A real Rockatansky place  
There's precious little going on  
Occupying a fuckload of space  

I have to eat and I want to drink  
And for that I need some money  
So I do my hours at the local shop  
It's double time on Sunday  

Fuck you McKenzie  

Fuck  
You  
McKenzie  

Fuck you McKenzie  
You have fucked me over again  

I made my peace  
Through gritted teeth  
I shut and locked the gate  
And then you sauntered in McKenzie  
Like you thought that we were mates  

Fuck you  
Fuck me  
Fuck this sunburnt fucking country  
Get fucked if you tell me  
That I shouldn't mind  

Fuck the roos  
Fuck the rabbits  
Fuck the sheep in the paddocks  
And unfuck my life  
If you would be so kind  

It's in-fucking-credible  
How in-fucking-edible  
A meat pie gets in the oven all day  

You flaming galah  
(Just joking, yeah nah  
That isn't something that we really say)  

Fuck you McKenzie  

Fuck  
You  
McKenzie  

Fuck you McKenzie  
You have fucked me over again  

Okay, alright  
Here's your fucking feed  
No need to piss and moan  
And don't thank me McKenzie  
Right, well I'm off home  

You're the cat with the cream  
Yet you shit on my sorrow  
Fuck you McKenzie  
And see you tomorrow
