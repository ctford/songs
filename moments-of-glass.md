## Moments of glass

I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
They're harder and harder to find  

It's not that the light is getting dim  
There's just a spiderweb of fissures in  
The medium that sits 'tween you and me  

I try to look at you  
I think you try and see me too  
But light and life and love  
Refract away  

I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
It seems they're in short supply  

Your eyes are bright your face is warn  
Your accent floating somewhere on  
The boat you slipped aboard  
For just ten pounds  

When you disembarked mother enquired  
About a maid to "do for her"  
A laugh, "Best get used to  
Doing for yourself"  

I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
You don't know who I am  
But you're kind
