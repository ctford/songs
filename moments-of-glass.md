## Moments of glass

I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
Specks of grandmotherly time  
I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
They're harder and harder to find  

It's not the light that's getting dim  
There's just a spiderweb of fissures in  
The medium that sits 'tween you and me  

I try to look at you  
I think you try and see me too  
But light and life and love refract away  

I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
They're harder and harder to find  
I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
It seems they're in short supply  

Your eyes bright your face is warn  
Your accent floating somewhere on  
The ship you slipped aboard for just ten pounds  

When you arrived mother enquired  
About a maid to "do for her"  
A laugh, "Get used to doing for yourself"  

I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
They're harder and harder to find  
I've come to collect  
Some more moments of glass  
You don't know who I am  
But you're kind
