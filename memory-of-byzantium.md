## Memory of Byzantium

This is a song  
For the memory of Byzantium  
For things we planned but never but never did  
If we could end the wars  
At last we might close the temple doors  

She said, "Perhaps we'd be happy  
To change it up and relocate east  
There's not much for the two of us here  
And the winter lasts longer each year  
Or so it seems"  

This is a song  
For the memory of Byzantium  
For things we said but never but never meant  
There's Greek fire in the water  
Without a change of wind there will be slaughter  

I said, "Perhaps we'd be happy  
In a place with a view of the sea  
'The Lord upon the Golden Horn  
Is laughing in the sun'  
So it seems to me"  

This is a song  
For the memory of Byzantium  
For things we miss but never had  
Of Theodosian walls  
And the careless clap of canon balls  


(The quote about the Golden Horn is from
G. K. Chesterton's poem ['Lepanto'](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47917/lepanto).)
