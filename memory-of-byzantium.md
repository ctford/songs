## Memory of Byzantium

This is a song  
For the memory of Byzantium  
For things we miss but never had  

Of Theodosian walls  
And the careless clap of canon balls  

This is a song  
For the memory of Byzantium  
For things we said but never but never meant  

There's Greek fire in the water  
Without a change of wind there will be slaughter
