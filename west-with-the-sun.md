## West with the sun

I'll run away  
I'll get away  
But my heart will go west  
With the sun  

A parting kiss  
Like fairy floss  
Dissolves on the tip  
Of my tongue  

I stumble past  
The watershed  
And I like a river  
Will run  

Into a sea  
Of salt and scree  
My shadow stretching  
Out in front
