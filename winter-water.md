## Winter water

The in-  
-fluence  
Of grifters pumped by algorithmic pulse  
Ah well  
Just cos they say it doesn’t mean it’s false  
Good for  
Mood disorders, chronic pain and more  
For that  
I’m stripping off and walking into…  

…winter water up to my knees  
Keep moving before it can hurt  
Nothing better than leaving land  
To bring me back to earth  
There’s no room in my head for any thought  
But fuck that’s cold!  
All this growing old  
Is growing old  

Submit  
Submerge  
A hypothermic needle for your health  
The rush  
The touch of something bigger than yourself  
In the end  
The fathead sun will swallow us, but not  
Today  
It’s tipping out its sunbeams on the…  

…winter water up to my waist  
Just dive in before it can hurt  
Nothing better than leaving land  
To bring me back to earth  
There’s no room in my head for any thought  
But fuck that’s cold!  
By far my preferred option  
Is growing old  

“In summer time  
The living is easy”  
The Solstice lied  
“Each season has its perks  
And peccadilloes”  
Her brother replied  

My toes  
Touch sand  
My legs remember how to stand again  
Yes and  
I’m ready for whatever comes and then  
Oh shit  
Somehow I have to get from here to home  
Ah well  
That fucking sun is dropping sunbeams  

Winter water drips down my chest  
It’s bracing but I have felt worse  
Nothing better than leaving land  
To bring me back to earth  
There’s no room in my head for any thought  
But fuck it’s cold!  
All this talk of growing old  
Is growing old
