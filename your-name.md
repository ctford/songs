## Your name

I heard your name  
A year ago  
It meant something sad and sweet  
In a language I didn't know  

I heard you name  
From a mutual friend  
Who told me you didn't like stories  
Unless you knew how they would end  

There's always a huntsman  
There's always a wolf  
There's always a young girl  
Who's lost in the woods  
And I feel like the whole cast  
Whenever I hear your name  

I heard your name  
You introduced yourself  
I don't know what I said in return  
But I must have said it well  

I hear your name  
Everywhere I go  
In overheard conversations  
About football games and clothes  

There's always a murder  
There's always a clue  
But who was the victim, dear  
Me or you?  
The jury is hung  
And the tabloids howl your name  

There's always some fact  
There's always some fiction  
It's got to the stage  
I don't know which is which and  
If my life were a song  
Its title would be your name
