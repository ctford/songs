## Dolorem ipsum

_Neque porro quisquam est  
Qui dolorem ipsum  
Quia dolor sit amet  
Consectetur  
Adipisci velit_  

Cicero opined  
And laid down his quill  

I don't love pain  
For its own sake  
It's just a mark  
To hold my place  
A starting point  
A chunk of space  
Where good and evil  
Can take place  

_Neque porro quisquam est  
Qui dolorem ipsum  
Quia dolor sit amet  
Consectetur  
Adipisci velit_  

Cicero sighed  
And took up his quill  


(The Latin roughly translates as "No one seeks pain for pain's sake"
and is from Marcus Tullius Cicero's [_De finibus bonorum et malorum_](https://books.google.com/books?id=C0ZuoEMeeeAC&dq)
or "On the ends of good and evil".)
