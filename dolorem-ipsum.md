## Dolorem ipsum

"Neque porro quisquam est  
Qui dolorem ipsum  
Quia dolor sit amet  
Consectetur  
Adipisci velit"  

Cicero opined  
And laid down his quill  

I don't love pain  
For its own sake  
It's just a mark  
To hold my place  
A starting point  
A piece of space  
Where good and evil  
Can take place  

"Neque porro quisquam est  
Qui dolorem ipsum  
Quia dolor sit amet  
Consectetur  
Adipisci velit"  

Cicero sighed  
And took up his quill
