## Dolorem ipsum

_Neque porro quisquam est  
Qui dolorem ipsum  
Quia dolor sit amet  
Consectetur  
Adipisci velit_  

(Liberal translation from the Latin:  
No one wants pain for pain's sake)  

Cicero opined  
And laid down his quill  

I don't love pain  
For its own sake  
It's just a mark  
To hold my place  
A starting point  
A chunk of space  
Where good and evil  
Can take place  

_Neque porro quisquam est  
Qui dolorem ipsum  
Quia dolor sit amet  
Consectetur  
Adipisci velit_  

Cicero sighed  
And took up his quill
